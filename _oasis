Synopsis: Build reverse dependencies of a package in OPAM.
Description:
  opam-build-revdeps builds the reverse dependencies of a given OPAM package.
  It can also build two different versions of the same package, in order to
  compare the results.
  .
  This program has been designed to test what can other packages can break in
  OPAM, if we inject a new version. It was specifically targeted to check OASIS
  reverse dependencies.
